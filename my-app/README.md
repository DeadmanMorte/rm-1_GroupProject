To-Do-List Application

Introduction:

Welcome to the To-Do-List Application! This project was created to serve as a simple and efficient way to keep track of your tasks. With basic CRUD functionality, the objective of this application is to keep the user organized by providing the ability to add, edit, update, and delete tasks from their to-do-list.

Team:

This application was created by Isaac Kim, Anthony Diaz, and Tyler Williams, inspired by the need for all of us to be on track and on time.

Getting Started:

In order to use this application, simply add a task in the open field and click either the "+" button or the "Add task" button. Your task will then be sent to our Postgres server, where you will be able to see it added to the DOM. Once added, you can either check the task as complete by hitting the checkbox or delete the task by clicking the trash icon.

Acknowledgements:

We would like to give credit to the following link "https://youtu.be/ldYcgPKEZC8", as it helped in the coding process of this project.

Technologies:

Within this application we utilized Sequelize, PostgresSQL, Typescript and JavaScript, CSS, HTML, React and Bootstrap.

Technical Information: 

For startup, simply run nodemon or npm start in terminal of both the my-app terminal as well as the backend terminal. As this project was composed by aspiring software engineers, there are numerous deficiencies within the project which we would appreciate help with. To do so, simply fork the project from one of our contributors' Github accounts, clone into a preffered working machine and work as you desire.

Issues: 

Currently the outstanding issues our project contains include insufficent typing for Typscript and minimal CRUD Update fuinctionality. Ideally, we would like to have the project eventually include full functionality not only for itself and the Todo lsit but one for the ToBuy shopping list as well as a ToChat contact/recontact list.


API Documentation:

For our project we designed it to be as simple as possible in order to implement the rudimentary concepts we have been learning. Towards this end our application has only two endpoints. The front end point includes the user facing UI wherein a user simply inputs a desired list item into the input area and selects the button to append the provided input unto the list to be saved and shown. The back end poiunt includes a SQL database to store and retrieve the provided input list items as well as any other inputs previously given. 






















# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
